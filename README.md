* Hello there! 
* This is my portfolio git repository where you can browse through a custom app i build from scratch in golang,
while self learning the inner working of this amaizing coding experience of a language.

* This is a simple app that allows you to create a new horse / investment(gamble on a horse) and save it to a database.
